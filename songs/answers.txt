Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

  1 Analyze the songs for musical features: You could use tools like audio analysis software to examine the songs on the list and identify common musical features, such as tempo, rhythm, melody, and harmony. This could give you insight into the listener's musical preferences and tendencies, and help you identify patterns or trends in their music taste.

    Look for patterns in song lyrics: Another way to analyze the listener's audio aura is to examine the lyrics of the songs on the list and look for common themes or motifs. This could give you insight into the listener's personal beliefs, values, and experiences, and help you understand what emotional and psychological needs their music is fulfilling.

    Use data mining and machine learning: If you have access to a large dataset of music preferences and behaviors, you could use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the listener's musical preferences. This could involve analyzing factors such as the genres, artists, and musical features of the songs they listen to, as well as their demographic and psychographic characteristics.
